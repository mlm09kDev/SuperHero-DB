## Tech Stacks
* [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) + [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/) - RESTful API and networking client.
* [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) - Dependency injection.
* [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - A collections of libraries that help you design rebust, testable and maintainable apps.
    * [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - Local persistence database.
    * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel) - UI related data holder, lifecycle aware.
    * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Observable data holder that notify views when underlying data changes.
    * [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) - Declarative way to bind data to UI layout.
    * [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) - Fragment routing handler.
* [Groupie](https://github.com/lisawray/groupie) - Simplified way to build complex layout in RecyclerView.
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading.
* [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - Light-weight threads for background operations. (Upcoming)

## Architecture

![MVVM](./pictures/Architecture.png)

Followed Google recommended [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide) to structure the architecture based on MVVM and reactive UI using LiveData observables.

* **View**: Activity/Fragment with UI-specific logic only.
* **ViewModel**: It keeps the logic away from View layer, provides data streams for UI and handle user interactions.
* **Model**: Repository pattern, data layers that provide interface to manipulate data from both the local and remote data sources. The local data sources will serve as [single source of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth).

## API Key ðŸ”‘
You will need to provide developer key to fetch the data from <a href="https://www.superheroapi.com/">Super Hero</a> API.
* Generate a new key from [here](https://www.superheroapi.com/). Copy the key and go back to Android project.
* Define a variable `api_token` in gradle.properties with the double quotes, it looks like

```kotlin
api_token="5**************2"
```

```kotlin
 buildTypes.each {
        it.buildConfigField 'String', 'API_TOKEN', api_token
    }
```
* Perform gradle sync.
